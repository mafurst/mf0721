# Sample Tool Inventory Management Project

This project is a sample of an inventory management system for tool rental. This system keeps track of the cost of rentals for available tools, and generates rental agreements for them.

Since this is a sample project, it is not setup to use a database. For any actual inventory management system, you should always use a database. 

This project is built using Spring Boot on Java 11. It will run on any machine using Java 11 and can be interacted with using the command line. 

This project uses jUnit for unit and integration testing. Each service and utility is unit tested for normal and edge cases. The user interface is tested using integration testing of specific test cases designed to replicate interface usage.
